# CliniPet Project @ Masterschool

## **Tasks**:
- *Task 1.1*:  
  Clean data in registration form and create `registration_clean`.  
  Write a query that will fix the problems in the columns in healthtail_reg_cards, in particular: 
 - will apply standardisation ( or just upper case)  on column patient_name
 - will remove non-numeric data from column owner_phone
 - will replace missing values in column breed with “Unknown”  
Data provided by the client HealthTail: [healthtail_reg_cards.csv](https://github.com/armandaslid/clinipet_project/blob/main/project_files/healthtail_reg_cards.csv), [invoices.csv](https://github.com/armandaslid/clinipet_project/blob/main/project_files/invoices.csv), [visits.csv](https://github.com/armandaslid/clinipet_project/blob/main/project_files/visits.csv).
